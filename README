rtcheckcalls
-----------------------

Python daemon to control billing for asterisk in a simple way.

Running
1. First create config.json file with the following contents:

{"user": "db_user", "password": "your_password", "database": "db_name", "secret": "user_secret", "logo": "your_site_name"}

User, password and database (and optionally host) are credentials for your mysql database. The database and user must already exist, but
the script will create the tables by itself on connection.

2. Adapt paths on root_resource.py

3. Then adapt and run run.sh script to enjoy!

Dependencies:
-----------------------
python-sqlalchemy python-mysqldb

Usage
-----------------------

Provides the following urls:

localhost:8081/ - main page
localhost:8081/voip - extensions info and server stats
localhost:8081/prices - prices
localhost:8081/user/<ext> - user info including credit
localhost:8081/user/addcredit/<ext>/<credit> - add credit for a user

and new ones.

you just need the main page anyways.


Asterisk configuration
-----------------------

You need to enable cdr-custom and cel-custom logging in your asterisk (1.8).
